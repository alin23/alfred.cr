Create [Alfred Workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) in Crystal with ease.

## Installation


Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  alfred:
    github: kiliankoe/alfred.cr
```

## Prerequisites

You need [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with the paid [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) upgrade.

## Usage

Here's a quick and dirty example, more documentation will be added soon ðŸ˜›


```crystal
require "alfred"

item = Alfred::Item.new do |i|
  i.title = "An awesome title"
  i.subtitle = "An awesome subtitle"
  i.arg = "argument"

  mod = Alfred::Mod.new do |m|
    m.arg = "mod arg cmd"
    m.subtitle = "some other subtitle"
  end

  i.add_mod Alfred::ModKey::CMD.to_s, mod
end

Alfred.output item

# => {"items":[{"title":"An awesome title","subtitle":"An awesome subtitle","arg":"argument","mods":{"cmd":{"valid":true,"arg":"mod arg cmd","subtitle":"some other subtitle"}}}]}
```

## Thanks

Shoutout goes to [BenchR267](https://github.com/BenchR267) with whom I explored much of Alfred's quirks ([goalfred](https://github.com/BenchR267/goalfred) came out of that ðŸ˜Š) and [alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy), from which I shamelessly stole (as in *imitation is the sincerest form of flattery*) the basic API.
